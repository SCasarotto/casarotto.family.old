We made our studio\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapartment our own with lots of love and creative furniture layouts!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn many ways, Lincoln Park was a new chapter in our relationship\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith a place we could call our own and end the period of long\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdistance dating.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn August 2018, we ended up shifting to a 2 bedroom apartment with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStu’s sister, Blair. Living with Blair was an amazing chance for us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto all get close while we were all chasing down our early careers in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChicago. Then come October 2018, our relationship would take the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnext step with our engagement!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</CopyWrapper>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Gallery\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpageSize={12}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\timages={datingThroughTheYearsImages}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\taltPrefix='Through The Years'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t\t\t</GalleryRow>\n\t\t\t\t\t<GalleryRow>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<CopyWrapper>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<CopyTitle>The Proposal</CopyTitle>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<CopySubtitle>As written by the surprised fiancé</CopySubtitle>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat started as a fun weekend plan with good friends visiting,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tturned out to be one of my biggest surprises and exciting days that\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI could ever ask for.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI was told that Hayden and Forrest Wilsey would be staying with us\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor the weekend and that Forrest needed to get some Chicago footage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor a work project he was working on. I was so excited to see good\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends and visit some of our favorite Chicago sites. So Blair, Stu,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHayden, Forrest and I started off with some yummy brunch at one of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tour favorite places followed by checking out places like Millennium\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPark, Jay Pritzker Pavilion, the Lurie gardens, and walking near the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlake. While we ran around the city having such a fun day, Forrest\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas capturing so many moments “for work” but also of all the little\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoments and fun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the day is coming to a close, of course we make a pit stop to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLincoln Park, where our relationship experienced so many firsts and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbig moments. As we are walking on the South Pond Park bridge (aka\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tone of my favorite places on earth) Stuart takes Courtney to look at\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe skyline. Stuart then leans over and breaks the news, that our\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfriends were not here to hang out with us for work, but instead we\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere here to bring our journey full circle. And with big surprise in\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmy face, Stuart gets down on one knee and asks me to marry him and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof course I say yes with the biggest smile on my face!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Copy>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot only was being asked to spend the rest of my life with my best\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfriend enough to make my day, I was surprised by dinner party at one\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof our favorite sushi restaurants near our old apartment with our\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfamilies and some close friends. I could not be more thankful for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tall the love that we have in our life.
