I was so excited\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto see good friends and visit some of our favorite Chicago\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsites. So Blair, Stu, Hayden, Forrest and I started off with\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsome yummy brunch at one of our favorite places followed by\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tchecking out places like Millennium Park, Jay Pritzker Pavilion,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Lurie gardens, and walking near the lake. While we ran\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround the city having such a fun day, Forrest was capturing so\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmany moments “for work” but also of all the little moments and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAs the day is coming to a close, of course we make a pit stop to\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLincoln Park, where our relationship experienced so many firsts\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand big moments. As we are walking on the South Pond Park bridge\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(aka one of my favorite places on earth) Stuart takes Courtney\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto look at the skyline. Stuart then leans over and breaks the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnews, that our friends were not here to hang out with us for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twork, but instead we were here to bring our journey full circle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnd with big surprise in my face, Stuart gets down on one knee\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand asks me to marry him and of course I say yes with the\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbiggest smile on my face!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot only was being asked to spend the rest of my life with my\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbest friend enough to make my day, I was surprised by dinner\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tparty at one of our favorite sushi restaurants near our old\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tapartment with our families and some close friends. I could not\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbe more thankful for all the love that we have in our life. We\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare so excited to be moving forward together as partners for\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlife.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</CopyWrapper>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Gallery pageSize={12} images={processedImages} />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</>\n\t\t\t\t\t)}\n\t\t\t\t</GalleryContainer>\n\t\t\t</GallerySection>\n\t\t</PageWrapper>\n\t)\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
